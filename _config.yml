# notice, these links aren't actually used anymore because jekyll is broken and
# fucking base urls!!
# apparently string operations don't work inside templates, particularly the
# header.html.  So trying to do the if link.url.start_with?("http") didn't
# work, so there was no way to not include the base url on the github link.
# But it DOES work on the index.html?!?!?!?  Undoubtedly a bug in jekyll's
# parsing or something, sucks
#
# also we NEED the baseurl since this stuff is embedded inside github and "/"
# needs to be "/tumblr/colossus", but baseurl has to be "" when testing
# locally, BWHAHABASHSHSBAHB (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
